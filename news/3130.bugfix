Catch deprecation warnings for ``webdav.LockItem.LockItem`` and ``CMFPlone.interfaces.ILanguageSchema``.
The first has been moved to ``OFS.LockItem``, the second to ``plone.i18n.interfaces``.
In older upgrade code, we should still try the old import first.
Fixed deprecation warning for zope.site.hooks.
Fixed invalid escape sequence.
