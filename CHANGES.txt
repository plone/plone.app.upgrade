  a new skin called "Old Plone 3 Custom Theme", and then "Plone Default"
  will be reset to its typical configuration in a fresh Plone 4 site.

  GenericSetup export of all upgraded sites now.
  [hannosch]

  These have varying add-ons installed depending on the original site and its
  quite hard to get the same add-ons installed again in a new site.
  [hannosch]

- Added functional upgrade tests based on an actual zexp export of each major
  version of Plone. Each one is imported and upgraded. A diff of the upgraded

  in the toolset step. Be sure to update the locations for the tools which
  moved from CMFPlone to PlonePAS, for upgrades from very old sites.
