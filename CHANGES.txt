  [hannosch]

- Moved the code to remove old persistent Interface records into the
  recompilePythonScripts step. This step actually covers all objects.

  layers were customized, the layers and viewlet settings will be copied to
  a new skin called "Old Plone 3 Custom Theme", and then "Plone Default"
  will be reset to its typical configuration in a fresh Plone 4 site.
  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10399

- Enable the diff export in functional upgrade tests, we do a complete
  GenericSetup export of all upgraded sites now.
  [hannosch]

- Remove the hint of doing an export/import comparison for the full upgrades.
  These have varying add-ons installed depending on the original site and its
  quite hard to get the same add-ons installed again in a new site.
  [hannosch]

- Added functional upgrade tests based on an actual zexp export of each major
  version of Plone. Each one is imported and upgraded. A diff of the upgraded
  configuration vs the one of a completely new site is generated. Thanks to
